            <h2>When Shopping Fits Perfectly</h2>
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you order clothing online, there is the potential
               issue of the clothes not fitting upon arrival, requiring return. This can lead
                to a less-than-ideal user experience when shopping online for clothing, as 
                the inconvenience of having to return items and place new orders can be 
                frustrating and time-consuming, ultimately diminishing the overall satisfaction 
                of the online shopping experience.
            </p>
    
            <p>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TailorMyStyle is an online marketplace whose central 
              feature revolves around body measurements. This allows users to input their 
              precise measurements, ensuring a better selection of clothes that are tailored 
              to fit them accurately. This approach not only eliminates the uncertainty associated 
              with sizing but also enhances user satisfaction by delivering a more personalized 
              and convenient shopping experience.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach is particularly beneficial for a broad customer 
            segment that includes individuals who value the convenience of online shopping but are
            often deterred by the uncertainty of sizing. It caters to those who have unique body 
            shapes and sizes, making it especially appealing to individuals with non-standard proportions, 
            those in-between standard sizes, or anyone who simply seeks a more precise fit. It offers 
            customers a simple solution to shop from the comfort of their homes, as it offers a hassle-free, 
            tailor-made shopping experience that caters to their specific needs and preferences.

          <h2>Sizing Up the Competition</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our arena is no small stage; our competitors include 
            major fast-fashion retail giants, which have established their presence in 
            Romania: FashionDays, AboutYou, Modivo, and Zalando. Additionally, we share 
            the market with other niche players specializing in custom formal attire, such as 
            Filipcezar, Sarto, and AtelierDeCroitorie.ro
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike most of our competitors, who primarily rely on 
            individual tailoring workshops, our platform presents a novel approach by 
            centralizing the services of multiple providers. In addition, it empowers users 
            to input their own precise measurements, meaning that each garment is truly tailored 
            to the unique shape and dimensions of each individual.

          <h2>Metrics that Measure Success</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of our mission lies the desire to eliminate the 
            frustration of ordering clothing, only to return it due to sizing issues. Additionally, 
            we're committed to aiding retailers in streamlining their product return processes 
            to cut costs. Therefore, a critical metric we focus on is the "Return Percentage." Our 
            aspiration is to outperform our competitors and deliver a smaller product return rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Startups face an exciting challenge in drawing customers to their 
            innovative solutions. That's why our next key metric revolves around "Conversion Rate per 
            Source." Through skillful management of channels like organic searches, paid advertising, 
            social media, and referrals, our goal is to captivate customers and offer them a firsthand 
            experience of our remarkable solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cart abandonment rates in the world of online fashion shopping pose 
            a significant concern. This metric presents a vital challenge in the customer journey as 
            potential buyers, including fast fashion enthusiasts, often demonstrate their intent by 
            populating their carts but eventually do not complete the purchase. This highlights the 
            need for us to prioritize user experience, competitive pricing, and the overall efficacy 
            of our e-commerce platform as we seek to capture the attention and loyalty of fast fashion 
            consumers. User-friendly interfaces, personalized recommendations, targeted incentives, and 
            optimized checkout processes are the keys to retaining customers. The additional steps of 
            adding body measurements to the user experience may discourage customers when browsing our 
            application. As such it is essential to implement a friendly process of onboarding users 
            into the world of tailoring.

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to keep a competitive edge, our strategic investment focus is 
            distributed across several critical areas within our cost structure. Firstly, we recognize the 
            importance of the technology and software development department. This investment is essential 
            to create a flexible, intuitive, and user-friendly web application that aligns with our mission.
            Moreover, we acknowledge the essential role of a robust IT infrastructure investment. It is essential 
            in providing our customers with a highly responsive and consistently available platform. We adopt a 
            scalable approach, permitting additional investments as traffic increases.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our pursuit of broader visibility, we assign resources for advertising and 
            promotional materials. Our goal is to attract and retain a substantial customer base, thereby enhancing 
            our competitive edge. Recognizing the value of constructive human interaction in customer support, we 
            allocate a substantial investment of time to this domain. We aim to differentiate ourselves by delivering 
            exceptional customer service that surpasses industry standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our ultimate goal is to minimize product returns,they cannot be avoided 
            entirely. As such, it is important to think about investing into the management of return policy and 
            processes. Additionally, we factor in the costs associated with payment processing fees and the 
            essential field of SEO.
          </p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These investments collectively reinforce our competitive stance and further

          <h2>Data Collected</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female-23: Does order clothes online, never had issues with the clothes ordered 
            for herself. Only once had a problem, when ordered clothes as a gift for someone. Has been to tailor for 
            special occasion - ball. Liked the design she saw in a fashion house, tracked down the designer and went 
            to the designer's workshop to get a tailored dress (even though it was far away). Highly customizable and 
            liked the ideas the tailor suggested for modifying the dress.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female-22: Only shops online because lack of time, patience and deceiving prices. 
            Orders in bulk and returns clothes that don't fit. For any clothes that she liked and did not fit she set 
            a stock alarm for when the desired size was in stock. Boyfriend's father is a tailor, so for any slight 
            adjustments for clothes she reaches out to him. Does not have any tailored clothes because her boyfriend's 
            father is no longer full time tailor due to low demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female-22: Does not shop online at all. Needs to try on clothes to see if they fit 
            and to test the quality of the material used (always looks for best price-quality products). Last clothing 
            product ordered online was 8-10 years ago. Never had problems with size. The material was the issue. She has 
            been to a tailor for special occasion. The tailor was a family friend, and that was the selling factor. 
            Highly customizable dress.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female-23: Mostly shops in store because of between-sizes issue, but has learned the 
            average size for clothes in case she needs to order online. Never had the problem of needing to return a product. 
            Has been to the tailor in middle school. Did not like the experience because of unpleasant behaviour from the tailors.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female-23: Searches online for clothing but goes to shops to try them out before buying, due to 
            inconsistent sizing across shops. Had problems with size differences at the same online shop. Had few problems with ordering 
            online, most of them offered as hand-me-down to her friends, few returned. Has been to tailors for adjustments and for special 
            occasions. Tailor was in another city, but she still went to it because of the design of the dress. Found the tailor through 
            Instagram. Body measurements taken online, with help from the tailor through video call. Traveled to the tailor's workshop 
            for adjustments.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male-23: Buys clothes exclusively in physical shops due to sizing issues. Wants to try on before 
            purchasing because he wants to look good in the clothes he wears. Never ordered online, uses online websites to browse the 
            designs. Has been multiple times to a local tailor (referral from other acquaintances) for adjustments, last time summer 2022 
            for pair of jeans and a shirt, resulting in a perfect fit.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male-23: Never buys clothes online. Wants to have the perfect fit and good material. Has favorite 
            stores to go to. Does go to the tailor (his mom) for adjustments to jeans and shirts. Does not have any custom tailored 
            attire. Not willing to pay extra for tailored clothes, if the clothes bought from the store fit well.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female-22: She generally orders products online, but not clothes. She prefers to get clothes 
            from the shop because she has problems with sizes depending on the size of the item. She feels that sizes generally 
            differ from shop to shop. She has only been to the tailor to shorten her trousers.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male-22: He rarely ordered his clothes online, mostly from abroad because he couldn't find 
            unique pieces in the store. He prefers going to the shops because he has a problem with sizes. He would prefer custom 
            or more unique pieces, but the cost of made-to-order products discourages him. He went to the tailor to have his suit 
            pants shortened.
