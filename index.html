        <h2>Problem & Solution (Value Proposition)</h2>

        <h4>Problem</h4>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you order clothing online, there is a
          potential issue of the clothes not fitting upon arrival, necessitating
          return. This can lead to a less-than-ideal user experience when
          shopping online for clothing, as the inconvenience of having to return
          items and place new orders can be frustrating and time-consuming,
          ultimately diminishing the overall satisfaction of the online shopping
          process.
        </p>

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TailorMyStyle is an online marketplace whose
          central feature revolves around body measurements. This allows users
          to input their precise measurements, ensuring a better selection of
          clothes that are tailored to fit them accurately. This approach not
          only eliminates the uncertainty associated with sizing but also
          enhances user satisfaction by delivering a more personalized and
          convenient shopping experience.

          TailorMyStyle is diverse and is mainly represented by people who
          prefer to have clothes that are tailored to fit them. This approach is

          unique body shapes and sizes, making it especially appealing to
          individuals with non-standard proportions, those in-between standard
          sizes, or anyone who simply seeks a more precise fit. It offers

        <h4>How we differ?</h4>
        <p>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike most of our competitors, who primarily
          rely on individual tailoring workshops, our platform presents a novel
          approach by centralizing the services of multiple providers. In
          addition, our platform empowers users to input their own precise
          measurements, meaning that each garment is truly tailored to the
          unique shape and dimensions of each individual.
