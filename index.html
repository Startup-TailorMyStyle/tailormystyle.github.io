          <h2>When Shopping Fits Perfectly</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you order clothing online, there is the
            potential issue of the clothes not fitting upon arrival, requiring
            return. This can lead to a less-than-ideal user experience when
            shopping online for clothing, as the inconvenience of having to
            return items and place new orders can be frustrating and
            time-consuming, ultimately diminishing the overall satisfaction of
            the online shopping experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TailorMyStyle is an online marketplace whose
            central feature revolves around body measurements. This allows users
            to input their precise measurements, ensuring a better selection of
            clothes that are tailored to fit them accurately. This approach not
            only eliminates the uncertainty associated with sizing but also
            enhances user satisfaction by delivering a more personalized and
            convenient shopping experience.

          <h2>Online Shopping, Uniquely Yours</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This approach is particularly beneficial for
            a broad customer segment that includes individuals who value the
            convenience of online shopping but are often deterred by the
            uncertainty of sizing. It caters to those who have unique body
            shapes and sizes, making it especially appealing to individuals with
            non-standard proportions, those in-between standard sizes, or anyone
            who simply seeks a more precise fit. It offers customers a simple
            solution to shop from the comfort of their homes, as it offers a
            hassle-free, tailor-made shopping experience that caters to their
            specific needs and preferences.

          <h2>Sizing Up the Competition</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our arena is no small stage; our competitors
            include major fast-fashion retail giants, which have established
            their presence in Romania: FashionDays, AboutYou, Modivo, and
            Zalando. Additionally, we share the market with other niche players
            specializing in custom formal attire, such as Filipcezar, Sarto, and
            AtelierDeCroitorie.ro
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike most of our competitors, who
            primarily rely on individual tailoring workshops, our platform
            presents a novel approach by centralizing the services of multiple
            providers. In addition, it empowers users to input their own precise
            measurements, meaning that each garment is truly tailored to the
            unique shape and dimensions of each individual.

          <h2>Metrics that Measure Success</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the heart of our mission lies the desire
            to eliminate the frustration of ordering clothing, only to return it
            due to sizing issues. Additionally, we're committed to aiding
            retailers in streamlining their product return processes to cut
            costs. Therefore, a critical metric we focus on is the "Return
            Percentage." Our aspiration is to outperform our competitors and
            deliver a smaller product return rate.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Startups face an exciting challenge in
            drawing customers to their innovative solutions. That's why our next
            key metric revolves around "Conversion Rate per Source." Through
            skillful management of channels like organic searches, paid
            advertising, social media, and referrals, our goal is to captivate
            customers and offer them a firsthand experience of our remarkable
            solution.

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cart abandonment rates in the world of
            online fashion shopping pose a significant concern. This metric
            presents a vital challenge in the customer journey as potential
            buyers, including fast fashion enthusiasts, often demonstrate their
            intent by populating their carts but eventually do not complete the
            purchase. This highlights the need for us to prioritize user
            experience, competitive pricing, and the overall efficacy of our
            e-commerce platform as we seek to capture the attention and loyalty
            of fast fashion consumers. User-friendly interfaces, personalized
            recommendations, targeted incentives, and optimized checkout
            processes are the keys to retaining customers. The additional steps
            of adding body measurements to the user experience may discourage
            customers when browsing our application. As such it is essential to
            implement a friendly process of onboarding users into the world of
            tailoring.

            areas within our cost structure. Firstly, we recognize the
            importance of the technology and software development department.
            This investment is essential to create a flexible, intuitive, and
            user-friendly web application that aligns with our mission.
            Moreover, we acknowledge the essential role of a robust IT
            infrastructure investment. It is essential in providing our
            customers with a highly responsive and consistently available
            platform. We adopt a scalable approach, permitting additional
            investments as traffic increases.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our pursuit of broader visibility, we
            assign resources for advertising and promotional materials. Our goal
            is to attract and retain a substantial customer base, thereby
            enhancing our competitive edge. Recognizing the value of
            constructive human interaction in customer support, we allocate a

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our ultimate goal is to minimize
            product returns,they cannot be avoided entirely. As such, it is
            important to think about investing into the management of return
            policy and processes. Additionally, we factor in the costs
            associated with payment processing fees and the essential field of
            SEO.

          <p>

          <h2>Data Collected</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female-23: Does order clothes online, never
            had issues with the clothes ordered for herself. Only once had a
            problem, when ordered clothes as a gift for someone. Has been to
            tailor for special occasion - ball. Liked the design she saw in a
            fashion house, tracked down the designer and went to the designer's
            workshop to get a tailored dress (even though it was far away).
            Highly customizable and liked the ideas the tailor suggested for
            modifying the dress.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female-22: Only shops online because lack of
            time, patience and deceiving prices. Orders in bulk and returns
            clothes that don't fit. For any clothes that she liked and did not
            fit she set a stock alarm for when the desired size was in stock.
            Boyfriend's father is a tailor, so for any slight adjustments for
            clothes she reaches out to him. Does not have any tailored clothes
            because her boyfriend's father is no longer full time tailor due to
            low demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female-22: Does not shop online at all.
            Needs to try on clothes to see if they fit and to test the quality
            of the material used (always looks for best price-quality products).
            Last clothing product ordered online was 8-10 years ago. Never had
            problems with size. The material was the issue. She has been to a
            tailor for special occasion. The tailor was a family friend, and
            that was the selling factor. Highly customizable dress.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female-23: Mostly shops in store because of
            between-sizes issue, but has learned the average size for clothes in
            case she needs to order online. Never had the problem of needing to
            return a product. Has been to the tailor in middle school. Did not
            like the experience because of unpleasant behaviour from the
            tailors.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female-23: Searches online for clothing but
            goes to shops to try them out before buying, due to inconsistent
            sizing across shops. Had problems with size differences at the same
            online shop. Had few problems with ordering online, most of them
            offered as hand-me-down to her friends, few returned. Has been to
            tailors for adjustments and for special occasions. Tailor was in
            another city, but she still went to it because of the design of the
            dress. Found the tailor through Instagram. Body measurements taken
            online, with help from the tailor through video call. Traveled to
            the tailor's workshop for adjustments.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male-23: Buys clothes exclusively in
            physical shops due to sizing issues. Wants to try on before
            purchasing because he wants to look good in the clothes he wears.
            Never ordered online, uses online websites to browse the designs.
            Has been multiple times to a local tailor (referral from other
            acquaintances) for adjustments, last time summer 2022 for pair of
            jeans and a shirt, resulting in a perfect fit.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male-23: Never buys clothes online. Wants to
            have the perfect fit and good material. Has favorite stores to go
            to. Does go to the tailor (his mom) for adjustments to jeans and
            shirts. Does not have any custom tailored attire. Not willing to pay
            extra for tailored clothes, if the clothes bought from the store fit
            well.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Female-22: She generally orders products
            online, but not clothes. She prefers to get clothes from the shop
            because she has problems with sizes depending on the size of the
            item. She feels that sizes generally differ from shop to shop. She
            has only been to the tailor to shorten her trousers.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Male-22: He rarely ordered his clothes
            online, mostly from abroad because he couldn't find unique pieces in
            the store. He prefers going to the shops because he has a problem
            with sizes. He would prefer custom or more unique pieces, but the
            cost of made-to-order products discourages him. He went to the
            tailor to have his suit pants shortened.

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking with more people from the target
            customer segment we saw that the people that use online shopping
            platforms do so because they find it easier and faster than buying
            from physical shops. On the other hand, th reason people do not use
            ever online shopping platforms is because they had bad experiences
            with them because of inconsistent sizing. They also find shopping
            for clothes a chore, because most don't have the time to try on
            clothes in physical shops.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As such, we came up with the following
            persona : Antonia, a young lady who recently got a job as a
            marketing specialist at a big firm. The firm requests her presence
            in the office almost daily. Moreover, she interacts with a lot of
            people, so she needs to make very good first impressions.

          <h2>Target market</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about our targeted market it is
            important to mention from the beginning that according to studies it
            is forecasted that more than half of Romania’s population will use
            online commerce by 2025 [1].
            <b>Currently, only 45% of Romanians order online</b>, although the
            Internet penetration rate is over 90.
            <b
              >The ecommerce market in Romania has around 100 online stores that
              record over 1,000 orders per day.</b
            >
            However, it is expected to grow up to three times in the coming
            years based on various digital transformation trends that will
            define local electronic commerce. [1]
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2021, the online fashion Market in
            Romania was worth 894 millions of euros [2]. The projected growth of
            the Romanian Fashion eCommerce market anticipates reaching
            US$1,400.7 million by 2023, representing 17.6% of the total
            eCommerce market in Romania. This sector is poised for further
            expansion in the coming years and the expected compound annual
            growth rate (CAGR) from 2023 to 2027 is estimated at 1.0%,
            contributing to a forecasted market volume of US$1,456.4 million by
            2027. [3]
          </p>
          <p>
            Within the Fashion market, the ECDB identifies three distinct
            sub-markets: Apparel, Footwear, and Bags & Accessories. [3]

          <h2>Competition and its market share</h2>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The online share refers to the proportion of
            the retail volume that is transacted via the Internet. It includes
            purchases via desktop PC, tablet or smartphone, both via website or
            app. Only retail of physical goods is taken into account. [3]

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Romanian Fashion retail market, the
            online share is 35.0% and will increase by an average of 11.8% to
            54.6% by 2027. [3]

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our journey of entering the targeted
            market we have to face competition from prominent fast-fashion
            retail giants with a well-established presence in Romania, including
            FashionDays, Answear, Bonprix, AboutYou, Modivo, and Zalando.
            Furthermore, our market landscape includes niche players focusing on
            custom formal attire, such as Filipcezar, Sarto, and
            AtelierDeCroitorie.ro.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2022, the leading online stores in the
            Romanian fashion market were FashionDays, eMAG, Epantofi, AboutYou,
            and H&M. FashionDays emerged as the market leader, generating
            revenues of US$245.6 million. Following closely was eMAG with sales
            reaching US$181.4 million, and Epantofi with US$78.3 million in
            sales. Collectively, these top three online stores held a
